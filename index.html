            <p>I recently graduated with a degree in Robotics Engineering, where I focused on applying advanced
                techniques to solve real-world problems. For my final project, I developed a machine condition
                monitoring system using k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), which helped detect anomalies and predict failures in
                mechanical systems. This project allowed me to build a strong foundation in machine learning and data
                analysis. Additionally, I have gained practical experience in web development using HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript, creating interactive and user-friendly web interfaces. Although I donâ€™t yet have
                professional work experience in this field, my academic background, personal projects, and eagerness to
                learn have prepared me to thrive as a developer. I am excited to apply my skills and contribute to
                innovative projects in a dynamic development environment, while continuing to grow and expand my
                expertise.
